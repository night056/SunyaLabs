            <h3>ABOUT:</h3>
        <p><b>The Sunya Lab, part of the Centre for Advanced Computing and Communication at RSET, is dedicated to conducting fundamental research in the vast fields of computer science and artificial intelligence. The lab is firmly committed to taking a leading role in both pioneering new theoretical approaches and developing applications that can make a significant societal impact.
            <br><br>
            Currently, Sunya Lab's research activities are concentrated in three primary domains:
            <br>
            <br>
&emsp;&emsp;1. Artificial Intelligence & Data Science: In this research area, the lab strives to comprehend and create systems, whether living organisms or artificial constructs, that possess the ability for intelligent reasoning, perception, and behavior. Specific research endeavors encompass core AI, computational biology, computer graphics, computer vision, human language technology, machine learning, medical informatics, robotics, and the semantic web.
            <br>
            <br>
&emsp;&emsp;2. Systems: Sunya Lab's research in this domain seeks to uncover fundamental principles, models, metrics, and tools that apply to computer systems, encompassing both hardware and software aspects. This research delves into areas such as compilers, computer architecture and chip design, operating systems, programming languages, High Performance  & Distributed Computing and computer networks.
            <br>
            <br>
&emsp;&emsp;3. Theory: Within the realm of theory, Sunya Lab investigates the mathematical aspects of computation and the implications they carry. Specific research areas encompass algorithms, complexity theory, computational geometry, cryptography, distributed computing, information security, and quantum computing.
            <br>
            <br>
The lab actively encourages student involvement in its research projects, offering opportunities for undergraduates to participate through internship programs and providing research assistantships for graduate students.
<br>
<br>
In addition to that the lab provides High Performance Computing support to other fields of Engineering and Sciences to accomplish their computational objectives.
